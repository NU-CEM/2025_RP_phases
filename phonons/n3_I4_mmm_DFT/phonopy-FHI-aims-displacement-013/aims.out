  #  Suggested "tight" defaults for Ba atom (to be pasted into control.in file)
  #
  #  The onset of the cutoff pot'l WAS set to 8 A by default, because the neutral
  #  Ba atom is a large atom. However, this is very expensive. The radius should be
  #  much smaller in real-world situations, where Ba will be ionic. Please check
  #  and reduce the cutoff radius explicitly.
  #
  #  2015/11/12 : f and g functions from tier2 added to default basis set choice.
  #               These functions make a difference in the "delta test".
  #               Reduced the default cutoff radius to 6AA. The free-atom 6s function
  #               requires more. However, 6AA is already VERY expensive for
  #               any production calculations. In fact, revisit this choice for
  #               ionic systems to see if a smaller cutoff radius will do.

  # For methods that use the localized form of the "resolution of identity" for
  # the two-electron Coulomb operator (RI_method LVL), particularly Hartree-Fock and
  # hybrid density functional calculations, the highest accuracy can be obtained by
  # uncommenting the line beginning with "for_aux"  below, thus adding an extra g radial
  # function to the construction of the product basis set for the expansion.
  # See Ref. New J. Phys. 17, 093020 (2015) for more information, particularly Figs. 1 and 6.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -8.19787437 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.99999981
  | K-point:       3 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -7.02056191 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      1.17731246 eV between HOMO at k-point 3 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      1.17731363 eV for k_point 1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -8.14345590 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.99999981
  | K-point:       3 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -7.03593582 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      1.10752007 eV between HOMO at k-point 3 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      1.10752126 eV for k_point 1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.43943431 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.38999243 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.40341331 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.40679253 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.40799335 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.40851004 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.40818983 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.40818912 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.40818924 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.40818929 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.40818929 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.40818930 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.40818930 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -7.40818930 eV
  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.44500983 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.99999981
  | K-point:       3 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -7.13755833 eV (relative to internal zero)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.30745150 eV between HOMO at k-point 3 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.30745337 eV for k_point 1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  What follows are estimated values for band gap, HOMO, LUMO, etc.
  | They are estimated on a discrete k-point grid and not necessarily exact.
  | For converged numbers, create a DOS and/or band structure plot on a denser k-grid.

  Highest occupied state (VBM) at     -7.44500983 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      1.99999981
  | K-point:       3 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.500000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  Lowest unoccupied state (CBM) at    -7.13755833 eV (relative to internal zero)
  | Occupation number:      0.00000000
  | K-point:       1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)

  ESTIMATED overall HOMO-LUMO gap:      0.30745150 eV between HOMO at k-point 3 and LUMO at k-point 1
  | This appears to be an indirect band gap.
  | Smallest direct gap :      0.30745337 eV for k_point 1 at    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000 (in units of recip. lattice)
  The gap value is above 0.2 eV. Unless you are using a very sparse k-point grid,
  this system is most likely an insulator or a semiconductor.

  | Chemical Potential                          :    -7.40818930 eV
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :       -5220287.108257323 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :       -5220287.108257323 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :            -16.530111157 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

  Of course, there are many other important community references, e.g., those cited in the
  above references. Our list is limited to references that describe implementations in the
  FHI-aims code. The reason is purely practical (length of this list) - please credit others as well.

   One or more s.c.f. cycles took more than 50 s.c.f. iterations.
   It might be worth adjusting your convergence settings. For example,
   metals need a larger broadening and a smaller "charge_mix_param" value than semiconductors.

 *********************************************************************
   Your are running FHI-aims on many cores. To achieve optimal
   performance for your particular architecture, it might be necessary
   to tune the following compilation and calculation settings:
    * Choosing the right Scalapack and MPI Libraries for your
       architecture is essential. If in doubt, refer to the
       documentation or the sysadmin of your supercomputer.
    * Please review our documentation of Makefile choices, particularly
       for ELPA, in the manual.
    * Some of the following FHI-aims keywords or combination thereof
       may be helpful:
        - FHI-aims setting: use_local_index .true.
        - FHI-aims setting: load_balancing .true.
        - FHI-aims setting: use_alltoall .false.
   Be mindful that the usefulness of these keywords can depend on your
   actual run and on the actual computer you are using. Please check
   their description in the manual and perform specific benchmarks to
   determine what is optimal for your computer. More detailed
   information and examples can be found at:
